Technologies: AWS, Cross-Platform (Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, Linux, Web), MS SQL Server,
MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, REST API
•Developed and deployed a cloud-based, cross-platform location analytics application supporting
Android, iOS, desktop, and browsers, leveraging AWS for deployment scalability and data resilience.\n
•Integrated interactive maps that display tower locations and allow users to search by Tower ID or
visualize all towers within a user-defined radius, with geospatial queries for accurate filtering and
display.
•Engineered a custom map-rendering solution that fetches and serves map visuals from a dedicated
tile layer database, providing fast, consistent, and offline-friendly mapping experiences across all
supported platforms.
•Designed and implemented robust database failover mechanisms: if the primary data source or
authentication system is unavailable, the application seamlessly switches to backup databases,
ensuring uninterrupted access and user authentication.
•Coordinated with telecom nodal officers for the acquisition and verification of CellID datasets,
maintaining calibration and authenticity of networks data.
•Leveraged AWS services throughout to provide global deployment, horizontal scaling, and high
availability for all critical operations and data services.
